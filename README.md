## Overview
With Chrome Season Tracker you can track your current status for your favourite series.

##Install

You can download/install the Extension from the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/season-tracker/mjkglmfdpllgfmngkcmnjcfibokdaije" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a> or install it manually by downloading it and dragging the folder onto your Chrome extension page. (See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked" target="_blank">Chrome Extension Developement</a>) 

##API's
Chrome Season Tracker uses omdbapi.com to access all IMDB data.
I am planning to replace it at least for some parts by http://www.tvmaze.com/ 's official API

##Contribute
If you want to contribute to the developement feel free to report bugs or open pull requests.

NOTE: This plugin is very limited and mainly for my personal use. 
Not everything is working and there are only very limited features.
